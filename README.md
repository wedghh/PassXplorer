In the modern digital ecosystem, password protection has become a critical component of safeguarding sensitive information. Whether it's personal files, confidential business documents, or legally sensitive data, encryption mechanisms—especially those relying on passwords—are widely used to ensure data privacy and integrity. However, the increasing complexity of password standards, coupled with the human tendency to forget them, has led to a growing demand for effective password recovery solutions. 

Traditional tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat have long served this purpose by employing brute-force and dictionary-based methods. While technically sound, these tools often require command-line expertise, lack intuitive interfaces, and do not incorporate intelligent prediction mechanisms to optimize recovery time. In this context, artificial intelligence presents a promising opportunity to enhance password recovery methods by predicting likely passwords based on historical patterns and user behavior. 

PassXplorer is designed to bridge this gap. It is a cross-platform, GUI-based password recovery tool that supports common file formats such as ZIP, PDF, DOCX, and RAR. By integrating machine learning with traditional cracking techniques, it aims to reduce the time required to recover passwords while remaining user-friendly and efficient.
